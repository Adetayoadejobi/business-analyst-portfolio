## Hi I'm Adetayo Adejobi

I’m a Business Analyst focused on digital transformation, systems integration, and cloud-enabled solutions. I specialise in bridging the gap between business needs and technology by producing clear, testable requirements and supporting delivery teams through implementation and adoption.

I have experience working on transformation initiatives, system integrations, and cloud-related projects, collaborating with business and technical stakeholders to deliver solutions aligned with organisational goals.
